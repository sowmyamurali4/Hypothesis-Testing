# Conclusion
By Hypothesis Testing at 95% level of significance, we can conlcude the following in this dataset:
Claims by Smokers is higher than that of Non-Smokers
The BMI for Female Customers is different than BMI of Male customers
The Proportion of Smokers is not significantly higher across regions
The Mean BMI of Female Customers with Zero, One and Two Children are equal.

# Customer Insights:
The mean Age for the Customers is around 30 yrs. Though there are significantly more customers in the 18-25 age Bracket.
Customers(both male and female) above the age of 35 yrs atleast have one Child/dependent
The Average BMI, around 33, is fairly consistent across genders and between smokers and non-smokers. The BMI average falls under the Over-weight to Obese category. We also see that young customers (under 25) also have high BMI index. This could either be an error while collecting data, or the customers for Axis Insurance may have underlying health issues.

# Reservations about Results:
Even though the percentage of customer distribution is different across all four regions, statistically it doesnt hold. The percentage of Non-smokers is fairly consistent across all four regions. Hence its possible that there isnt significant increase of smokers across regions
For the last hypothesis; since we failed to reject the Null Hypothesis, the conclusion is that all three Means are equal/same. However visually there seems to a difference in the Mean BMI between female with 1 children and female with 2 children. This could be due to the high variance in Females with 2 children.
# Customer-Insights
The mean Age for the Customers is around 40 yrs. Though there are significantly more customers in the 18-25 age bracket.
Customers(both male and female) above the age of 35 yrs at least have one Child/dependent.
There are less tobacco smoking customers (20.55%) compared to non-smokers.
The Average BMI, around 33, is fairly consistent across genders and between smokers and non-smokers. The BMI average falls under the Over-weight to Obese category. We also see that young customers (under 25) also have high BMI index. This could either be an error while collecting data, or the customers for Axis Insurance may have underlying health issues.

#Recommendations:
The insurance company has more Senior to Older customers. The company needs to engage or provide more incentives to attract younger and fitter customers.
We need further data to analyze why there are very less tobacco smoking customers.
With a majority of customers in the Over-weight category, the company can market benefits to encourage customers to get healthy. This may help reduce coverage due to weight related health issues.
There are very few customers with more than three dependents. We need more data to analyze this further
